          <p>My name is Saubhagya, and I'm a self-taught developer from India. I began my software development journey in 2020 , in the first year of my collage making simple portfolio pages
            and getting into programming.</p>
          <p>I have worked with many different types of programming languages and technologies, and i like to explore new and upcoming stuff.</p>
          <p>The language in which I'm most experienced is <span className='text-yellow-400'>JavaScript</span> and my favorite tech is  <span className='text-[#50bdd3]'>react</span>.
            In my opinion <span className='bg-blue-600 rounded-md px-2'>Nextjs-React</span> is a very capable architecture that can handle anything from simple web pages to full blown web apps.</p>
          <p>I also like to contribute to open-source projects, It helps me understand how code is structured in different projects.</p>
          <p>
            My hobbies include making 3D stuff in blender and designing thumbnails for my friend's storytelling youtube channel.
